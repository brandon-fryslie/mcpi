**Status Source**: STATUS-2025-11-05-232752.md (FZF TUI Issues - Critical Evaluation)
**Ship Checklist**: SHIP-CHECKLIST-FZF-TUI-v1.0-2025-11-05-234500.md
**Current Status**: FZF TUI at 95% - Ready for final verification and ship
**Current Focus**: Execute ship checklist (10-75 minutes depending on path)

## Current Status - 2025-11-05 Late Evening

### Project Health
- **CLI Status**: FUNCTIONAL ✅
- **Commands Working**: Core functionality operational ✅
- **Production Ready**: YES - pending 10-minute manual verification ✅
- **Current Focus**: Final verification then SHIP v1.0 🚀

### Latest Assessment Results
**FZF TUI Status** (from STATUS-2025-11-05-232752.md):
- **Issue 1 (mcpi-tui-reload command)**: RESOLVED ✅
  - Command was already implemented (commit 7570251)
  - Fixed via `uv tool install --editable . --force`
  - Reload mechanism works correctly
  - Just needed fresh installation, no code changes

- **Issue 2 (Header truncation)**: CONFIRMED COSMETIC ISSUE (Optional) 🔶
  - Single-line header (113 chars) truncates on standard terminals
  - Users cannot see ctrl-d, ctrl-i, enter, esc shortcuts
  - Fix: Multi-line header (30-60 min effort)
  - **NOT BLOCKING SHIP**: Functionality works perfectly, just poor discoverability
  - Can be deferred to v1.0.1 or included as optional polish

**Feature Completion**: 95% → 100% after manual verification
**Ship Readiness**: READY (minimum path: 10-20 minutes | polished path: 45-75 minutes)

## Active Work

### SHIP v1.0: FZF TUI Feature (READY TO EXECUTE)
**Ship Checklist**: SHIP-CHECKLIST-FZF-TUI-v1.0-2025-11-05-234500.md
**Status**: At ship decision point - choose minimum or polished path
**Current State**: 95% complete - All functionality verified via automated tests
**Effort**: 10-20 minutes (minimum) | 45-75 minutes (polished)

The fzf interactive TUI is **functionally complete and working**. All automated tests pass (28/28, 91% coverage). Only remaining task is manual end-to-end verification to confirm production readiness.

**Two Ship Paths Available**:

**Path 1: Minimum Viable Ship (10-20 minutes)**
- P0: Manual verification checklist (10 minutes)
- Result: Fully functional v1.0 with minor cosmetic issue (header truncation)
- Risk: Very low
- Recommendation: Good if speed is priority

**Path 2: Polished Ship (45-75 minutes)**
- P0: Manual verification checklist (10 minutes)
- P2: Header UX improvement (30-60 minutes) - makes all shortcuts visible
- P1: Documentation review (5 minutes)
- P3: Git commit review (5 minutes)
- Result: Professional v1.0 with excellent UX
- Risk: Very low
- Recommendation: **PREFERRED** - only 30-60 minutes more for significantly better UX

**Ship Checklist Includes**:
- Detailed 10-step manual verification procedure
- Optional header fix implementation (if choosing polished path)
- Success criteria and acceptance tests
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Deferred items for v1.1 (test infrastructure, packaging tests, etc.)

### Feature: Rescope Auto-Detection (LOWER PRIORITY)
**Backlog**: BACKLOG-RESCOPE-AUTO-DETECT-2025-11-05.md
**Status**: Ready to implement (deferred until FZF fix complete)
**Approach**: OPTION B (Conservative) - Auto-detect single scope, error on multiple
**Effort**: 3.5-5.5 hours total

This feature makes the `--from` parameter optional in the rescope command. The system will auto-detect the source scope when a server exists in exactly one scope, making the common case (95% of usage) simpler while maintaining safety for edge cases.

**NOTE**: This is lower priority than the FZF fix. Complete FZF work first.

**Key Work Items** (see detailed backlog):
1. P0-1: Add find_all_server_scopes() method (30-45 min)
2. P0-2: Make --from optional (15 min)
3. P0-3: Implement auto-detection logic (1-1.5 hours)
4. P0-4: Unit tests for new method (30 min)
5. P0-5: Integration tests (1-1.5 hours)
6. P0-6: Update existing tests (30 min)
7. P0-7: Update documentation (30 min)
8. P0-8: Manual testing and verification (30 min)

### Reference Documents
- **STATUS-2025-11-05-162258.md**: Latest assessment - FZF TUI evaluation (65% complete)
- **STATUS-2025-10-30-062049.md**: Previous assessment - CLI packaging issues (now resolved)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project architecture and development workflow
- **pyproject.toml**: Package configuration

### Archived Documents (Contradicts Reality)
The following documents claimed production readiness but were based on false assumptions:
- STATUS-2025-10-29-015500.md (claimed 90% ready - INCORRECT)
- BACKLOG.md (2025-10-29 version - OBSOLETE)
- RELEASE-PLAN-1.0-FINAL.md (2025-10-29 - INCORRECT timeline)
- PLANNING-SUMMARY-2025-10-29.md (optimistic summary - INCORRECT)
- COMPLETION-AUDIT-2025-10-29.md (audit of incorrect status - INCORRECT)

**Action**: These files should be moved to `archive/` with `.archived` suffix to prevent confusion.

## Timeline

### Revised Realistic Timeline
- **Emergency Day (Day 0)**: Fix packaging + verify commands (4-8 hours)
- **Day 1**: Investigate failures + fix bugs (8-16 hours)
- **Day 2**: Quality cleanup (6-10 hours)
- **Day 3**: Release prep + ship (4-6 hours)

**Total**: 22-40 hours over 3-4 days
**Target Ship**: 2025-11-02 or 2025-11-03
**Confidence**: 40% (many unknowns until packaging fixed)

### Comparison to Previous Plans
| Plan | Claimed Timeline | Reality |
|------|------------------|---------|
| Days 1-4 (OBSOLETE) | 90% ready | 0% - app doesn't run |
| Days 5-6 (OBSOLETE) | 2 days to ship | IMPOSSIBLE - CLI broken |
| Emergency Plan (NEW) | 3-4 days | REALISTIC |
| Timeline Slip | +1-2 days | NECESSARY FOR QUALITY |

---

## Key Metrics (Honest Assessment)

| Metric | Previous Claim | Actual Reality | Evidence |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Production Ready | 90% | 0% | CLI doesn't load |
| Commands Working | 16/17 | 0/17 | Cannot verify - CLI broken |
| Test Pass Rate | 83.6% | 84.1% | Tests pass, app fails |
| Test Errors | 0 | 0 | True but misleading |
| Days to Ship | 2 | 3-4 minimum | Account for unknowns |
| Confidence | 85% | 40% | Too many unknowns |

---

## Critical Lessons Learned

1. **Tests Passing ≠ Application Working**
   - Pytest injects pythonpath manually
   - Tests work in isolation, app fails in production
   - Need packaging tests to catch integration failures

2. **Always Verify Claims**
   - Don't claim "90% ready" without running the app
   - Don't dismiss 82 test failures without investigation
   - Don't extrapolate from tests to production

3. **Documentation Must Match Reality**
   - README examples untested
   - PROJECT_SPEC describes obsolete architecture
   - CLAUDE.md instructions don't work

4. **Honest Assessment > Optimistic Planning**
   - Better to under-promise and over-deliver
   - Account for unknowns in estimates
   - Add buffer for investigation work

---

## Success Criteria for 1.0 (Revised)

**MUST HAVE**:
- [ ] Packaging works (CLI loads)
- [ ] All 17 commands manually tested
- [ ] Critical bugs fixed
- [ ] Known issues documented honestly
- [ ] Documentation accurate

**SHOULD HAVE**:
- [ ] 82 test failures investigated
- [ ] Dead code deleted
- [ ] Packaging tests added
- [ ] Coverage > 50%

**NICE TO HAVE** (defer to 1.0.1):
- [ ] cli.py refactored
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] 80%+ coverage

---

## Next Actions

1. **Read PLAN-2025-10-30-062544.md** for detailed work items
2. **Start with P0-EMERGENCY-1**: Fix packaging (choose solution, implement)
3. **Then P0-EMERGENCY-2**: Manual test ALL commands
4. **Then proceed** through P0-EMERGENCY-3, P1, P2, and P0-SHIP items

**DO NOT**:
- Assume anything works without testing
- Dismiss test failures without investigation
- Claim production readiness without verification
- Skip manual testing of CLI
